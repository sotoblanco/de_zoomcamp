## Deploy and add schedule to run the pipeline using prefect every first of every month at 5am UTC

Prerequisites:

- The prefect server needs to be running. 
- File with the flow you want to deploy.

In a separate terminal run:

```bash
prefect orion start
```

In the command line run:

```bash
prefect deployment build q1.py:etl_web_to_gcs -n etl_task --cron '0 5 1 * *' -a
```

If you don't want to specify a cron job, you can remove the `--cron` flag and the pipeline will be deployed without a schedule.

```bash
prefect deployment build q1.py:etl_web_to_gcs -n "etl_task" -a
```

This create a yaml file with the name `etl_web_to_gcs-deployment.yaml` and the cron schedule is set to run the pipeline every first of every month at 5am UTC.

Go to the UI and confirm the deployment:
